    Welcome to the Cotton Leaf Disease Recognition System! üåøüîç
    
    Our mission is to help in identifying cotton plant diseases efficiently and provide treatment recommendations. Upload an image of a cotton plant leaf, and our system will analyze it to detect any signs of diseases and recommend appropriate fertilizers, nutrients, and pesticides. Together, let's protect our cotton crops and ensure a healthier harvest!
    
    ### How It Works
    1. *Upload Image:* Go to the *Disease Recognition* page and upload an image of a cotton plant leaf with suspected diseases.
    2. *Analysis:* Our system will process the image using advanced algorithms to identify potential diseases and their severity.
    3. *Results:* View the results and get recommendations for fertilizers, nutrients, and pesticides to treat the identified disease.
    
    ### Why Choose Us?
    - *Accuracy:* Our system utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for accurate disease detection.
    - *Comprehensive:* Not just detection, but also treatment recommendations based on disease and severity.
    - *User-Friendly:* Simple and intuitive interface for seamless user experience.
    - *Fast and Efficient:* Receive results in seconds, allowing for quick decision-making.
    
    ### Get Started
    Click on the *Disease Recognition* page in the sidebar to upload an image and experience the power of our Cotton Disease Recognition System!

        #### About Dataset
        This dataset consists of images of healthy and diseased cotton crop leaves categorized into 4 different classes:
        - Bacterial Blight
        - Curl Virus
        - Fussarium Wilt
        - Healthy
        
        #### About Our Approach
        Our system uses a deep learning model to classify cotton leaf diseases and estimate their severity. Beyond just detection, we provide personalized treatment recommendations including:
        
        - Suitable fertilizers
        - Required nutrients
        - Appropriate pesticides
        - Best cultural practices
        
        The recommendations are tailored based on both the disease identified and its severity level, ensuring that farmers can take the most effective actions to protect their crops.
